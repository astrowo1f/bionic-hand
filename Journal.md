##Day 1 (5/24) - 2-3 hours

- Began researching bionic hand design and the biomechanical structure of an actual hand.
- I want my design to be able to independently curl the fingers (over the IP joints) and rotate them (over the MCP joints), which in real hands basically requires two independent systems, flexors and extensors, to coordinate precisely. This would require 2 servos per finger which is unfeasible. Other robotic hands only allow fingers to curl, but I think that removes a lot of functionality. I think I can get away with implementing some sort of differential control. I will have to see how to do this once I prototype a finger and physically test the motion using strings.
